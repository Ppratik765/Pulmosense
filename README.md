## 1. Project Overview

PulmoSense is a complete, offline, edge-computing acoustic diagnostic ecosystem deployed natively on Android smartphones. Developed to act as a "Digital Stethoscope," the application utilises the ubiquitous smartphone microphone to capture raw respiratory audio, processes the signal into complex temporal-frequency visual arrays, and classifies pathological biomarkers (such as crackles and wheezes) using a heavily customised MobileNetV3Large deep learning architecture.

This repository contains both the Python-based data science pipeline (preprocessing, augmentation, and model training) and the full Jetpack Compose Kotlin Android application source code required to deploy the resulting TensorFlow Lite model.

## 2. Clinical Problem Statement

Respiratory anomalies, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Asthma, and localised Pneumonia, represent a massive global health burden. In resource-constrained and rural environments, the lack of specialised diagnostic hardware and trained pulmonologists creates a severe diagnostic bottleneck. Traditional stethoscope auscultation is inherently subjective and prone to variable interpretation.

While modern cloud-based AI solutions exist, they mandate high-bandwidth internet connectivity and introduce severe patient data privacy concerns, rendering them inaccessible where they are needed most. PulmoSense bridges this technological divide by forcing complex neural network inference entirely onto edge hardware, ensuring zero-latency, objective screening without internet reliance.

## 3. Core Features & Capabilities

* **100% Offline Edge Inference:** The 10MB quantised TensorFlow Lite model resides entirely within the Android asset directory, ensuring absolute data privacy and rural functionality.
* **Clinical-Grade Accuracy:** Achieves a 96.99% accuracy rate across 8 respiratory classifications through advanced class-weighting and transfer learning techniques.
* **Robust Acoustic Preprocessing:** Native conversion of 1D Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) audio to 2D Log-Mel Spectrograms utilizing JTransforms.
* **Guided Clinical UX:** Features an animated, physiological pacing algorithm to guide patients through a standardised 20-second respiratory cycle.

## 4. System Architecture Pipeline

The PulmoSense data flow operates in five distinct sequential stages from patient interaction to final diagnosis:

1. **Acoustic Capture:** The user undergoes a guided 20-second breathing exercise while the Android device records PCM audio at a 16 kHz sampling rate.
2. **Temporal Segmentation:** The 20-second audio array is systematically partitioned into four 5.0-second overlapping chunks to maintain temporal resolution.
3. **Spectral Transformation:** Short-Time Fourier Transforms (STFT) convert the raw 1D waveforms into 2D frequency domain maps, mapped to 128 Mel filter banks.
4. **Tensor Configuration:** Spectrograms are converted to a decibel (dB) scale, normalised, and duplicated across three RGB channels to format a `128 x 157 x 3` input tensor.
5. **MobileNetV3 Inference:** The TensorFlow Lite interpreter executes forward propagation on the four chunks, averages the resulting Softmax probability arrays, and returns a singular diagnostic confidence score to the Jetpack Compose UI.

## 5. Deep Learning Methodology

### 5.1 Dataset and Segmentation
The model is trained on the ICBHI Respiratory Sound Database. Due to the extreme heterogeneity of raw recording lengths (10 to 90 seconds), a sliding-window segmentation algorithm was developed to slice all acoustic data into uniform 5.0-second intervals prior to transformation.

### 5.2 Spectrogram Feature Extraction
Standard CNNs are optimised for spatial feature extraction. Consequently, raw 1D audio was converted into 2D visual representations. We utilized `librosa` to compute the STFT and applied a Mel-scale transformation with a maximum frequency cutoff (`fmax`) of 8000 Hz to encapsulate the primary acoustic domains of high-frequency crackles and continuous tonal wheezes.

### 5.3 Synthetic Data Augmentation
To counter the relatively limited scope of the ICBHI dataset and prevent model overfitting, deterministic digital signal processing augmentations were applied to the 5.0-second baseline chunks:
* **Time-Stretching (1.1x):** Utilising a phase vocoder to speed up the audio without altering pitch, simulating an elevated patient respiratory rate.
* **Pitch-Shifting (-2 steps):** Lowering the frequency via equal temperament scaling to account for physiological resonance variations in different chest cavity volumes.

These augmentations effectively tripled the dataset to over 10,000 highly distinct acoustic tensors.

### 5.4 MobileNetV3 Transfer Learning
To satisfy the draconian memory and computational constraints of edge deployment, `MobileNetV3Large` was selected as the foundational topology. The architecture leverages depthwise separable convolutions, Inverted Residual Blocks, and Squeeze-and-Excite (SE) attention mechanisms.

* **Frozen Base:** The model was initialised with pre-trained ImageNet weights. The bottom ~100 layers were frozen to preserve generalized edge and texture detection capabilities.
* **Fine-Tuning:** The top 50 layers were unfrozen, allowing the higher-level feature maps to adapt specifically to the unique horizontal and vertical frequency bands of respiratory spectrograms.
* **Classification Head:** A custom dense classification head `(512 units -> Dropout 0.4 -> 256 units -> Dropout 0.3 -> 8-class Softmax)` was integrated to map the extracted features to specific pathologies.

### 5.5 Loss Optimisation and Class Weighting
The ICBHI dataset exhibits catastrophic class imbalance, heavily favouring COPD over rare conditions like Bronchiectasis. To prevent a majority-class bias during backpropagation, dynamically calculated, heuristic class weights were integrated into the Categorical Cross-Entropy loss function. These weights were strictly capped at a maximum multiplier of 5.0 to prevent exploding gradients.

The network was compiled with the Adam optimiser utilising a highly conservative learning rate of `0.0001`. A `ReduceLROnPlateau` callback was implemented to halve the learning rate upon validation loss stagnation, ensuring precise convergence at the global minimum.

## 6. Empirical Performance Metrics

Evaluation on an isolated, augmented test set confirmed the architecture's viability as a frontline screening utility. The parity between Precision and Sensitivity indicates successful mitigation of the COPD dataset bias.

| Metric Classification | Percentage Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Global Accuracy** | 96.99% |
| **Macro-Averaged Precision** | 97.11% |
| **Sensitivity (Recall)** | 96.91% |
| **F1-Score** | 97.01% |

*Note: The model weights yielding the absolute minimum Validation Loss were preserved via an Early Stopping temporal checkpoint prior to final evaluation.*

## 7. Android Application Engineering

### 7.1 Native UI and UX Paradigms
The frontend is constructed exclusively in Kotlin using the Jetpack Compose declarative UI toolkit. 

* **Physiological Pacing:** To eliminate irregular acoustic captures, the recording interface features a dynamically scaling vector orb that guides the patient through a rigid 4-second inspiration and 4-second expiration cycle over a 20-second interval.

### 7.2 Edge Inference Execution
The Python Keras model was compressed via the TensorFlow Lite Converter using standard Post-Training Quantisation. The resulting `pulmosense.tflite` binary is loaded directly into the Android device's RAM via a `MappedByteBuffer`. Input tensors are supplied utilising the `tensorflow-lite-support` library, and the output probabilities are mapped to the 8 primary disease classifications dynamically.

6. Connect an Android device (API Level 24+) via USB and enable USB Debugging.
7. Click the **Run 'app'** (Green Arrow) button in the top toolbar to compile and install the application.

## 10. Future Roadmap
The current architecture provides a robust foundation for active clinical screening. Future iterations of the PulmoSense platform will target expanded telemetric capabilities:

* **Passive Nocturnal Monitoring:** Implementing continuous, ultra-low-power overnight inference loops to track sleep apnea occurrences and nocturnal asthma exacerbations without significant battery degradation.

* **Decentralised Telehealth Routing:** Automated generation of encrypted PDF diagnostic reports containing the raw spectrograms and AI confidence scores. These payloads will be engineered to transmit via asynchronous Bluetooth mesh networks or offline UPI rails to connect rural patients with remote pulmonologists.

* **Federated Learning:** Investigating on-device training protocols to allow the model to adapt to localized acoustic environments and noise profiles without centralizing sensitive patient data.
